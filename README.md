## About

This is a sports-betting web application designed to discover discrepancies and opportunity in daily betting lines.
Our model tracks data over several years of major-league sports to deliver the most accurate predictions.

For each daily match, Agent ML will provide an expected score that 
can be compared to betting lines from across the industry.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
